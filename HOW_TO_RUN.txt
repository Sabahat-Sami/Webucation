HOW TO RUN
----------
1) Change into repository directory:
$cd Webucation

2) Server / Backend Setup (requires python version >=3.9):
(activate a python virtual environment)
(setup PSQL on your device; PSQL settings should be default -- user should be 'postgres' and host should be 'localhost')
$cd server
$pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a new file in the server directory called "config.py" (if it does not exist).
Open "config.py" and write the following two lines in it:
DATABASE_PASSWORD = '{your PSQL password here}'
SECRET_KEY='secret'  

To init your Webucation database (with dummy data):
$python setup_db.py
(You can view this dummy data in the sql folder)

Run backend:
$python main.py

3) Client / Frontend Setup:
(open a separate terminal and navigate to Webucation folder again)
$cd client
$npm install --force
$npm start

Finally navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
